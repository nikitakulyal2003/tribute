    <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
        <p>
            Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, was an English mathematician and writer, primarily known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, making her one of the first computer programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lovelace's keen insight into the potential of computers extended far beyond their ability to crunch numbers; she envisioned a future where computers could perform tasks in various fields including music, art, and more. Her contributions laid the groundwork for the field of computer science, making her a revered figure in technology.
